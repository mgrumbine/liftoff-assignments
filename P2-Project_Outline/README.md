## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Can you imagine a world without small businesses? You just canâ€™t, right? Small businesses are gathering places for people from all walks of life, provide spaces for friends and family to catch up, study, do business, and to enjoy a beverage and bite to eat, and enthusiastically support their communities. As a small business owner, there are endless pieces to keep track of in order to succeed, and one of the major parts is ensuring you have enough supply to meet the demand of your loyal customers. 

With that in mind, our team decided to create an inventory management system for small business. Our project consists of an inventory web app with management tools to optimize inventories, as well as inventory auditing, inventory control, and purchase order management. This inventory tracking app is designed to make small business owners' lives simpler, because tech isn't just for big, major corporations.
